		//and if they match the right combinations, they beat the level. If they take to long, the liopleurodon/mosasaur/
		//t-rex/whatever comes by and starts eating the pterasaurs, so they can't beat it. 
		//Meteor? Can I do the meteor? Is that too dark? Then again, I've already got a aquatic reptires coming in and eating the 
		//pterasaurs.
